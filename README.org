Area Under the Minimum of False Positives and Negatives

This R package provides an efficient C++ implementation of the AUM and
its directional derivatives, which can be used to optimize Area Under
the ROC Curve (AUC) in supervised binary classification and
changepoint detection problems.

** Installation

#+begin_src R
if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tdhock/aum")
