vignette comparing logistic regression to aum minimization?

2021.2.20

error checking for min.lambda values input to aum_diffs_penalty.

new aum_sort_interface C++ function (faster), older function renamed
to aum_map_interface.

2021.2.16

aum supports names for predictions (copied to row names of
derivative_mat).

2021.2.15

more C++ error checking / tests.

vignette comparing speed with penaltyLearning::ROChange.

2021.2.14

aum_diffs, aum_diffs_binary, aum_diffs_penalty for creating error
diffs data frame required for input to aum.

aum_errors for converting aum_diffs to canonical error functions
(which start at fp=0 and end at fn=0). plot.aum_diffs uses this to
show a default plot of the error functions.

fn.not.zero example data taken from feaure-learning-benchmark.

2021.2.12

First draft.
