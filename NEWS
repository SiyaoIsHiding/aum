TODOs

more C++ error checking / tests.

vignette comparing logistic regression to aum minimization?

aum could support named input/output? so could
aum_diffs_binary(c(negative=-1, positive=1)).

2021.2.14

aum_diffs, aum_diffs_binary, aum_diffs_penalty for creating error
diffs data frame required for input to aum.

aum_errors for converting aum_diffs to canonical error functions
(which start at fp=0 and end at fn=0). plot.aum_diffs uses this to
show a default plot of the error functions.

fn.not.zero example data taken from feaure-learning-benchmark.

First draft.
